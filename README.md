# Snappy Triggers by Alexander Shemaly

Snappy Triggers is a fast-pased 2D shooter game where the objective is to shoot down as many enemies as possible within the time limit.
At each round, different enemies will spawn on the screen and shooting them will earn you different number of points.
There are three rounds, each with their own different enemies and themes. Plus, a challenging boss round, where the enemies can also take down the player.
